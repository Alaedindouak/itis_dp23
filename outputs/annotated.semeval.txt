As a definitive treatment regimen has never been thoroughly evaluated for coronavirus infections , there is an urgent need to rapidly identify potential therapeutics to address future cases of nCoV. To determine an intervention strategy , the effect of interferon-a2b and ribavirin on nCoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 replication in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells was evaluated .

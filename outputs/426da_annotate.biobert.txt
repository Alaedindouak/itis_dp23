0	Inhibition of novel b @DISEASE$ replication by a combination of interferon-a2b and @GENE$ .	0
1	The identification of a novel b @DISEASE$ , nCoV , as the causative agent of severe respiratory illness in humans originating in Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Jordan has raised concerns about the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic similar to that of SARS-CoV. As a definitive treatment regimen has never been thoroughly evaluated for coronavirus infections , there is an urgent need to rapidly identify potential therapeutics to address future cases of nCoV. To determine an intervention strategy , the effect of interferon-a2b and @GENE$ on nCoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 replication in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells was evaluated .	0

6	Despite the significant increase in research on coronaviruses since the discovery of @DISEASE$ in 2003 , there is no definitive @GENE$ or therapeutic treatment for coronavirus infections in humans .	0
7	Despite the significant increase in research on coronaviruses since the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2003 , there is no definitive @GENE$ or therapeutic treatment for @DISEASE$ infections in humans .	0
8	Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that @DISEASE$ is sensitive to @GENE$ 28 and to various classes of interferon ( a , b and c ) 27,29 - 34 .	0
9	Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that @DISEASE$ is sensitive to ribavirin 28 and to various classes of @GENE$ ( a , b and c ) 27,29 - 34 .	0
10	The sensitivity of @DISEASE$ to @GENE$ appears to be cell line dependent , with concentrations as low as 50 mg/ml ribavirin being reported as effective 16 .	0
11	The sensitivity of @DISEASE$ to ribavirin appears to be cell line dependent , with concentrations as low as 50 mg/ml @GENE$ being reported as effective 16 .	0
12	In contrast , when used at higher doses other studies have found that @GENE$ alone reduced viral loads in over half of the patients and when combined with the viral protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir , patients had a lower incidence of adverse outcomes 16 unclear whether ribavirin alone was effective against @DISEASE$ 41 .	0
